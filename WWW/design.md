# Feedback System - Design Concept

## Design Philosophy

**Modern Academic Excellence**: Clean, professional design that balances academic credibility with modern usability. The interface should feel trustworthy and scholarly while remaining approachable for students.

**Minimalist Functionality**: Every element serves a purpose. Clean lines, generous white space, and intuitive navigation that doesn't overwhelm users with unnecessary complexity.

**Trust and Transparency**: Design elements that build confidence in the system - clear ratings, verified indicators, and transparent review processes.

## Color Palette

**Primary Colors**:
- Deep Navy: #1e3a8a (trust, academic authority)

**Monospace**: "JetBrains Mono" - For ratings, dates, and technical information

## Visual Language

**Academic Modernism**: Inspired by university publications and academic journals, but with contemporary web design principles.

**Grid-Based Layout**: Structured, organized presentation that mirrors academic paper layouts.

**Subtle Depth**: Minimal shadows and elevation to create hierarchy without distraction.
